# Optional dependencies for face recognition
# Install these separately after core dependencies are installed
# 
# EASIEST METHOD: Run install_face_recognition.bat (Windows) or install_face_recognition.sh (Linux/Mac)
#
# MANUAL INSTALLATION:
#
# Windows - Method 1 (Recommended - Pre-built wheel):
#   pip install dlib-binary
#   pip install face-recognition
#
# Windows - Method 2 (Using conda):
#   conda install -c conda-forge dlib
#   pip install face-recognition
#
# Windows - Method 3 (From source):
#   pip install cmake
#   pip install dlib
#   pip install face-recognition
#
# Linux/Mac:
#   pip install cmake
#   pip install dlib
#   pip install face-recognition
#
# NOTE: Face replacement will work with OpenCV's built-in face detection even without
#       face_recognition, but face_recognition provides better accuracy.
#
# For PyTorch (install based on your system):
# CPU only: pip install torch torchvision
# CUDA 11.8: pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# CUDA 12.1: pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
