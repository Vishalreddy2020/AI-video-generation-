# Advanced AI Video Generation Dependencies
# Install these for high-level AI video generation

# For Replicate API (recommended - easiest to use)
replicate>=0.25.0

# For Stability AI API
requests>=2.31.0

# For local models (optional, requires GPU and large model files)
# diffusers>=0.21.0
# transformers>=4.35.0
# accelerate>=0.24.0
# xformers>=0.0.22  # For faster inference

# Note: For true generative AI video, you need either:
# 1. API keys for services like Replicate, Stability AI, RunwayML
# 2. Or local models like Stable Video Diffusion (requires GPU and ~10GB+ VRAM)
